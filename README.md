# LearningGit

> The idea behind this is to teach git to the colleagues who wants to learn with concrete scenarios by introducing Gherking format. 

> First, talk about the scenarios and answer the question! What would you do?

## Scenarios

- Initialisation
   - You have decided in your team to develop a new application. You need to create a collaboration within your team so your colleagues can participate improving the application.
- Changing repository display name
   - You have created a repository in GitHub but you have realised that the displayed name of the remote repository is wrong.
- Changing repository name
   - You have created a repository in GitHub but you have realised that the name of the remote repository is wrong.
- Re-establish connection between local and remote git
   - You have changed the name of the remote repository and the your local git is not working any more.
- Sending assets to repository
   - You have created a new file in your local computer and you would like to share this file with you colleagues.
- Working in separate environment 
   - The customer asks you to implement new feature to the application.
- Setting up test environment 
   - The customer asks that they need a new environment to check the changes 
- Resolve Conflicts
   - You are implementing a new feature to the application. You have finished your changes and pushed your code to the repository. !!Damn!!. Somebody else also has changed something before your changes.
- Resolve Conflicts 2 
   - You are implementing a new feature to the application. You have finished your changes and pushed your code to the repository. !!Damn!!. Somebody else also has changed something before your changes and your push is not working.
- Scenario: Changing the any/old commit message
   - You had created very ugly commit messages earlier and you would like to change this old commit messages.
- Merge commits
   - You have created couple of commits and then you have realised that actually these commits should be only one.
- Sending any/old commit to main 
   - You are developing a new feature, during the time in a certain state of your development, the customer asks you to send this state to the test system, but somehow you have forgot to send this state and continued developing more requirements to the feature, then you have realised that you should have sent it.
- Using 3rd party code 
   - You have decided to use some functionality from another project in your organisation or in GitHub.
- Recovery 
   - You have decided to delete the branch you are working on for a reason and then you have realised that it was a mistake. 
- Go back in time 
   - You have realised that you have been implementing wrong requirements to the feature and you would like to go back to previous state of the branch. 
- Create a backup 
   - You would like to apply some git commands to a branch in a repository but you feel a little bit insecure because your git knowledge and experience is not quite good. What would you do? 
- Sensitive data in git 
   - While developing the application, you needed to save credentials to the config file (bad idea) to be able to run integration tests, yet then you have forgot to change this config file and pushed to the repository and multiple commits have been pushed on it.
- Change master to main 
   - You have a repository called 'LearningGit' and the primary branch is called 'master' and you would like to change it's name to 'main'.
